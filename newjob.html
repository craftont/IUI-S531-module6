            <h2>Aldi</h2>About a month ago I started a new job at Aldi until I graduate and find something else.
            My mom actually works at the division office for Indiana and she helped me get a shoe in for this position.
            Aldi is a really great job and will add well to my work experience, becuase Aldi is a very well-ran business.
            They treat their employees very fair, and provide strategies for high levels of effeciency.

            <h2>Past Experience</h2><br>Before working at Aldi, most of my previous experience was in the restaurant industry.
            I worked many fast food jobs as a teenager, and eventually became a server at a Longhorn, where I stayed for over 
            two years. I learned a lot from that job in terms of being self accountable and working with a wide variety of
            individuals.

            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>I am really enjoying my job at Aldi for the time being. I would like to start looking into 
            positions in my field, but right now I am just being present. After graduation, I plan on starting to look for jobs
            in informatics.
