            <h2>Home Life</h2>I live south of Indianapolis in between Shelbyville and Franklin in a, you could say, 
            vintage farmhouse. This house has been in my family for generations, and I have done a lot to fix it up
            and make it a comfortable home over the past few years. There are many things I would still like to finish
            though, like repaint the exterior, but all in due time.

            <h2>Pets</h2><br>I have two pets that live with me, a dog and a cat. But right now I am actually watching
            another dog for my mom while she is on vacation. My dog, Rico, is a pomeranian that sleeps almost all day, but 
            can get pretty wild when he wants to! My cat's name is Lewis and his favorite activity is messing with Rico!
            However, when my mom's dog comes to visit, Lewis finds it in himself to behave!

            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>As of now, the plan is to stay here until I graduate and find a job in information technology
            I imagine I will first try to find a position in Indy, but I am not opposed to visiting different states to find
            something great! Can't wait to see what the future holds.
