            <h2>Informatics</h2>A few years ago I switched majors from social work to informatics, and I am really
            glad that I did. For me, this type of field is more straight forward with relatively clear answers to 
            solve problems, and that's what works best for me. In addition to my major, I have aquired the certificate
            in HCI that focuses stronger on the user's perspective when interacting with technology. I feel incredibly
            prepared and ready to start putting all that I've learned into the real world!

            <h2>Past Experience</h2><br>Out of high school, I went to ISU to study aviation because that's what I wanted
            to do as a kid. However, unfortuantly, I was not ready to be that far from home at that point in my life. So
            I came back to Indy and started studying social work. I was able to participate in many meaninful experiences
            like being a member of a student comittee, and part of a service learning experience where we visited the 
            Indianapolis Women's Prison.

            <h2>Finland</h2>What I am most excited for is this study abroad program! I think this will be not only the 
            greatest experience I have had throughout my education, but also a fantastic way to finish my time in college.
            Here is a video that I use as my motivation!
